# Image Placeholders

Since this is a Jekyll setup, you'll need to add actual images to make the theme complete. Here are the images you should add to the `/assets/img/` directory:

## Required Images:

1. **baps-logo.png** (50x50px recommended)
   - The BAPS organization logo
   - Should be a circular or square logo that works well in the header
   - Used in the header navigation

2. **default-post.jpg** (600x400px recommended)
   - Default image for posts that don't have a specific image
   - Could be a general BAPS/temple image or abstract spiritual design

3. **welcome-post.jpg** (600x400px recommended)
   - Image for the welcome post
   - Could show the BAPS Bengaluru center or community gathering

4. **food-distribution.jpg** (600x400px recommended)
   - Image showing community service/food distribution
   - Could be volunteers serving food or community gathering

5. **guru-purnima.jpg** (600x400px recommended)
   - Image from Guru Purnima celebration
   - Could show spiritual gathering or traditional ceremony

6. **youth-workshop.jpg** (600x400px recommended)
   - Image from youth activities
   - Could show young people in workshop or group activities

## Image Guidelines:

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: Optimize for web (under 500KB each)
- **Dimensions**: Consistent aspect ratios work best
- **Content**: Should reflect BAPS values and activities
- **Quality**: High resolution but web-optimized

## Adding Images:

1. Save images in `/assets/img/` directory
2. Reference them in posts using: `image: /assets/img/filename.jpg`
3. Images will automatically resize and display properly in the theme

## Note:

For demonstration purposes, the site will work without these images, but adding them will greatly enhance the visual appeal and user experience.
